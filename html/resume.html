				I provided training and support for PrimeSuite for clinical and billing staff.  I provided support through email, phone, and in person. I managed projects and worked with other departments to implement a bi-directional interface with the hospital EMR Meditech, created a query to pull out referrals created and export them to a drop box to be picked up by another vendor, and handled the transition to version 17.10 and the conversion of templates to be ICD-10 compatible. I worked with vendors to meet deadlines for implementing new functionality and upgrades such as implementing Medfusion, Direct Messaging, Immunization Registries, and the Specialty Registry. I helped the providers to meet MU requirements and provide information for audits. I developed workflows for better utilization of PrimeSuite including editing templates and working with the staff to develop better processes. I also developed reports for recording financial, patient, and practice data. I have also been trained on Financial Intelligence for running, subscribing, and editing report contained within the product. I have worked closely with Greenway support to resolve issues such as superbly edits, bugs, and miscellaneous problems.
